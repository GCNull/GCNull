- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NullGJC
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in general programming excluding web dev. I'm also interested in systems programming and plan to learn more about it in the future.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the Rust langauge. I've used Python 3 for a couple of years now and played with other languages briefly. For now my main focus is learning Rust as it's a low level language which is something I haven't really delved into much. I would also like to have a career in software engineering. Once I'm comfortable with Rust I may go down the C/C++ route. Who knows...
