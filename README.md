- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GCNull
- ðŸŒ± I have a keen interested in systems programming and currently learning it.
- I've used Python 3 for a couple of years now and played with other languages briefly. For now my main focus is learning Rust as it's a low level language which is something I haven't really delved into much and enjoying using the Rus language a lot. I would love to have a career in software engineering. Once I'm comfortable with Rust I will go down the C/C++ route, which I look forward to.
